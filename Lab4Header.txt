* Program Overview:                                                                                     *
*   This SNOBOL program uses a text file to input data into a linked list of                            *
*   Employees and execute commands in order to manipulate the list. After every                         *
*   command, the program writes information about the execution to a separate text file.                *
*   After all the data from the file has been read, the program terminates.                             *
*                                                                                                       *
* Input:                                                                                                *
*   The program requires formatted data in a text file entitled "Lab4Data.txt"                          *
*                                                                                                       *
* Output:                                                                                               *
*   The program outputs a data file entitled "Lab4Ans.txt" containing information                       *
*   about the program's execution.                                                                      *
*                                                                                                       *
* Program Limitations:                                                                                  *
*   1) The program does not allow for real time user interaction, and the output file                   *
*   is overwritten after every execution.                                                               *
*                                                                                                       *
*                                                                                                       *
* Significant Program Variables:                                                                        *
*   input - the identifier for the input file                                                           *
*   output - the identifier for the output file                                                         *
*   cmd - a string that stores the first three characters read from a line of input. This is used to    *
*       determine the appropriate subroutine to execute.                                                *
*   head- an Employee node that serves as the list head. Used to reference the linked list.             *
*   current- an Employee Node pointer used in almost every procedure. Is used to traverse the list and  *
*           analyze data, manipulating it if need be.                                                   *
